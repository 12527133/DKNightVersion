DKNightVersion is a light weight framework. It's mainly built through `objc/runtime` library and reflection, providing a neat approach  adding night mode to your iOS app. A great many codes of this framework is automatically generated by Ruby script.

The most delightful feature of DKNightVersion is that it appends one more property `nightColor` to frequently-used UIKit components. It is easily-used and well-designed. Hope you have a great joy to use DKNightVersion to integrate night mode in your Apps.

# How to use

## Using night color

DKNightVersion is based on picker `nightColor`, such as `dk_backgroundColorPicker` `dk_separatorColorPicker` and etc.

Assign the night mode color picker you want to the `UIKit` component like this:

```objectivec
self.tableView.dk_backgroundColorPicker =  [DKColor pickerWithNormalColor:[UIColor whiteColor]
                                                               nightColor:DKColorFromRGB(0x343434)];
self.tableView.dk_separatorColorPicker = [DKColor pickerWithNormalColor:[UIColor lightGrayColor]
                                                             nightColor:DKColorFromRGB(0x313131)];
```

## DKColor

`DKColor` provides `- pickerWithNormalColor:nightColor:` to create `DKColorPicker`.

```objectivec
+ (DKColorPicker)pickerWithNormalColor:(UIColor *)normalColor nightColor:(UIColor *)nightColor;
```

`DKColor` also provides a cluster of convienient `API` like `UIColor` which returns `DKColorPicker` block, these block return the same color when switch to night mode or switch back.

```objectivec
+ (DKColorPicker)pickerWithUIColor:(UIColor *)color;
+ (DKColorPicker)colorWithWhite:(CGFloat)white alpha:(CGFloat)alpha;
+ (DKColorPicker)colorWithHue:(CGFloat)hue saturation:(CGFloat)saturation brightness:(CGFloat)brightness alpha:(CGFloat)alpha;
+ (DKColorPicker)colorWithRed:(CGFloat)red green:(CGFloat)green blue:(CGFloat)blue alpha:(CGFloat)alpha;
+ (DKColorPicker)colorWithCGColor:(CGColorRef)cgColor;
+ (DKColorPicker)colorWithPatternImage:(UIImage *)image;
#if __has_include(<CoreImage/CoreImage.h>)
+ (DKColorPicker)colorWithCIColor:(CIColor *)ciColor NS_AVAILABLE_IOS(5_0);
#endif

+ (DKColorPicker)blackColor;
+ (DKColorPicker)darkGrayColor;
+ (DKColorPicker)lightGrayColor;
+ (DKColorPicker)whiteColor;
+ (DKColorPicker)grayColor;
+ (DKColorPicker)redColor;
+ (DKColorPicker)greenColor;
+ (DKColorPicker)blueColor;
+ (DKColorPicker)cyanColor;
+ (DKColorPicker)yellowColor;
+ (DKColorPicker)magentaColor;
+ (DKColorPicker)orangeColor;
+ (DKColorPicker)purpleColor;
+ (DKColorPicker)brownColor;
+ (DKColorPicker)clearColor;
```

## Using DKNightVersionManager change theme

Use `DKNightVersionManager` sets the theme.

```
[DKNightVersionManager nightFalling];
```

If you'd like to switch back to normal mode:

```
[DKNightVersionManager dawnComing];
```

It's pretty easy to swich theme between night and normal mode.

## Make your own customize

### Notification

`nightFalling` method will post `DKNightVersionNightFallingNotification` when it is called. Similarly, `dawnComing` will post `DKNightVersionDawnComingNotification`. You can observe these notification in proper place, and make your own customize easily.

## Picking Color

DKNightVersionManager will pick the proper color with `DKColorPicker` block
